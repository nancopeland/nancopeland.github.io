	<h1>User testing: paywall checkout</h1>
<p class="date">November 02, 2020</p>
<h2>Brief history</h2>
<p>Over the past year, I've been working on the Slate paywall. After initially meeting with <a href="https://twitter.com/heidimoon">Heidi Strom Moon</a>, the product manager for the paywall, I broke out the project into three groups: site prompts, landing page &amp; checkout process and account management.</p>
<p>Before mocking, I checked out a few other sites. All sites started with an &quot;offer&quot; landing page and then I was asked for my account and payment information. Some sites had the account and payment forms on the same page as the landing page and some sites took you to a different page. I mocked up these two flows for Slate but wasn't sure which one would make for a better user experience so I decided to do a few rounds of user testing.</p>
<h2>User testing</h2>
<p>Over the course of designing this flow, I did many rounds of user testing to get the checkout process optimized for Slate's readers:</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392870677_1_page_-_1">1-page</a> vs. <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392875148_3_page_-_1">3-page</a> experience</h3>
<p>For the first test, I tested a 1-page checkout experience vs. a 3-page checkout experience. I screened for users that read media sites at least once per week.</p>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="checkout experience that stays on 1 page" src="/img/checkout/UT1_1page.gif">
		<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392870677_1_page_-_1">1-page checkout</a></span>
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="checkout experience that is broken up into 3 pages" src="/img/checkout/UT1_3page.gif">
		<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392875148_3_page_-_1">3-page checkout</a></span>
	</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Overall, users understood both processes. When I asked which experience users preferred (something I am trying to not do anymore because I don't think an experience should be dictated by preference), they preferred the 1-page experience so I decided to go with the 1-page experience.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/397971678_1-Page_Steps_-_LP">Forgot password experience</a></h3>
<p>For the next test, I wanted to test switching from the account creation form to the log in form. Slate has a lot of active commenters who have accounts so I thought this might be a hurdle they'd have to figure out if they wanted to subscribe to Slate in the future.</p>
<p>One issue I had with this round of testing was that Invision doesn't allow <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp">smooth scrolling</a> transitions (which is what I had envisioned for the 1-page experience) so I couldn't mimic a coded experience as well as I had hoped.</p>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="log in form with forgot password link" src="/img/checkout/UT2_login_form.png">
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="forgot password form" src="/img/checkout/UT2_forgot_password.png">
	</div>
	<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/397971678_1-Page_Steps_-_LP">Forgot password experience</a></span>
</div>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> I asked users to subscribe as if they already have an account but can’t remember their password. While 2 of the 8 users couldn't find the &quot;forgot password&quot; link, <strong>the users who went through the whole “forgot password”  thought it was straightforward.</strong></p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/1-page.html">Coded 1-page experience</a></h3>
<p>Because of the limitations with Invision and smooth scrolling, I wanted to test a coded version of the 1-page experience, just to make sure.</p>
<p><img src="/img/checkout/UT3_coded_1page.gif" alt="coded 1-page checkout experience">
<span class="caption"><a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/1-page.html">Coded 1-page experience</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Users, specifically older users, had varying degrees of difficulty (8 out of 10 users) logging into their account and subscribing. Because of this, I wondered if I could <strong>test this same flow and set of users with a coded 3-page experience and see if I got the same results.</strong> Accounts are always difficult so I thought simplifying each step might help.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/3-page_plans.html">Coded 3-page experience</a></h3>
<p>4 users (of 10 total) had a bit or a lot of difficulty with this task and only 2 of those users were in the “older” category. From this, I assumed the <strong>3-page experience was easier to understand for users trying to go from the “create account” form to the “log in” form.</strong></p>

<h2>Decision</h2>
<p>Based on the user feedback, I decided to go with the 3-page checkout process with very clear links to “log in” and “create account” to toggle between the two forms. I think this is more easily understood by users, specifically “older” ones (which Slate has more of than “young” ones).</p>
